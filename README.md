<p><b>Draw on the canvas, then get the JS script to render it on the HTML canvas. A tool for graphic designers and developers.</b></p>
If anyone wants to add something to Canvascript, then they should fork the linted files, then I will minify that file and accept the changes. This is not a dead repo and I will continue to make changes.
